\section{Introduction}

\section{Theory}
\subsection{Fission barrier}
When observing the average binding energy per nucleon, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:binding_energy_per_nucleon}, one can see that for $A \approx 60$ the binding energy per A peaks, and then starts to decrease for increasing A. For nuclei situated to the right of this peak, it is thus possible to release energy by splitting in two lighter fragments, that is to fission. However, when studying the chart of nuclei , one will observe that only a handfull of nuclei have spontaneous fission as their main decay mode, and they are generally heavy elements far from the valley of stability. This  is due to the so-called fission barrier.

 In the liquid model, the fission barrier is described as a smooth, parabolic barrier, and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:smooth_fission_barrier}. It describes the energy needed to separate the two fission fragments as a function of separation distance. The fission barrier is due to both the nuclear force and the Coloumb force. A picture on why there is a fission barrier, is that in order for the two would-be fission fragments to separate, they have to get out of the potential well that is the nuclear force, and then pass the Coloumb barrier surrounding the nucleus. Thus energy must be applied for the fragments to be able to separate. This energy needed is often referred to as the activation energy, and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:smooth_fission_barrier} as the difference in energy between the ground state of the nucleus, and the maximum of the fission barrier potential.

The energy released in fission is about the same as the activation energy needed to overcome the fission barrier. Those nuceli that have an energy release though fission that allows them to overcome most of the fission barrier, have a highter probability of tunnelling through the barrier \cite{Krane1988} (p.481). These nuclei are called the spontaneously fissioning nuclei. However, most of the nuceli are not able to overcome the fission barrier by themselves, and thus are not unstable to spontaneous fission. This explains why the number of spontaneously fissioning nuclei are so few, even though it is energetically possible for plenty of the heavier nuclei to fission.
